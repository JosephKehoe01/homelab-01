Moving into **Junior Cyber / IT Support**. BSc Cyber Security + fresh homelabs (Linux hardening, log triage) and **ISC2 CC** in progress.
I like turning fixes into reusable playbooks for teams. Open to Service Desk / Junior Analyst roles (London/remote).
Happy to share a 60-sec intro + repo. DMs open ðŸ™Œ
